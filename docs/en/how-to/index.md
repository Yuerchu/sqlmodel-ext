# How-to guides

> **Task-oriented.** How-to guides help you accomplish **a specific goal**. They assume you already know the basics (you've finished the [tutorials](/en/tutorials/) or you're already familiar with async SQLModel) and now face a concrete problem that needs a direct procedure.
> Every guide is a recipe for "how to do X": prerequisites, steps, common pitfalls.

## By topic

### API endpoints

- [Paginate a list endpoint](./paginate-a-list-endpoint) — `TableViewRequest` + `ListResponse[T]`
- [Integrate with FastAPI](./integrate-with-fastapi) — Standard patterns for the 5 endpoint types (GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE / LIST)

### Data models

- [Define JTI (joined table inheritance) models](./define-jti-models) — Use when subclasses have many distinct fields
- [Define STI (single table inheritance) models](./define-sti-models) — Use when subclasses add only 1–2 extra fields

### Concurrency & consistency

- [Handle concurrent updates](./handle-concurrent-updates) — Use `OptimisticLockMixin` to prevent lost updates
- [Prevent MissingGreenlet errors](./prevent-missing-greenlet) — `@requires_relations` + `lazy='raise_on_sql'` + static analysis: three layers of defense

### Performance

- [Cache queries with Redis](./cache-queries) — `CachedTableBaseMixin` + `configure_redis()`

## What how-to guides are not

- **Not tutorials.** Guides assume you know the basic library idioms. If `await User.save(session)` doesn't ring a bell, start with the [tutorials](/en/tutorials/).
- **Not reference.** Guides only list the **parameters needed for the task at hand**, not every option. For full signatures see [Reference](/en/reference/).
- **They don't explain the "why".** If you want to know "why does sqlmodel-ext implement it this way", go to [Explanation](/en/explanation/).

## Can't find your guide?

If your task isn't listed, it might be:

1. **Tutorial-level** ("how do I create my first model") → see [Tutorials](/en/tutorials/)
2. **Reference-level** ("the full parameter list of `save()`") → see [Reference](/en/reference/)
3. **A new scenario** → please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Foxerine/sqlmodel-ext/issues) to propose a new guide
