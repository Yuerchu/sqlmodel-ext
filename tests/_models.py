"""
Synthetic STI hierarchy used by regression tests.

Intentionally placed outside any test function so the polymorphic metaclass
queues the classes onto ``_sti_subclasses_to_register`` at import time. The
conftest fixture drives the two-phase registration and schema creation.

Hierarchy:
    Tool (STI root, has its own table)
    +-- FunctionA   - declares ``max_files`` with default 100
    +-- FunctionB   - declares ``timeout`` with default 30
    +-- FunctionC   - declares nothing extra (sibling with no own fields)

The STI bug under regression: FunctionA's Pydantic default 100 would leak
into the shared ``tool.max_files`` SA Column.default. Inserting a FunctionB
or FunctionC row would then silently materialise ``max_files = 100`` in
the sibling row because the ORM falls back to ``Column.default`` when the
attribute is absent from the sibling's ``__dict__``.
